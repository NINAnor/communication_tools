# Science communication tools for NINA

This is a place where we can collect code and ideas for communication tools within NINA. It probably makes sense to split up most software we develop, e.g. in separate repositories, but this could function as a central hub.


Here we can list things we like to se made:

1. Document templates for scripting languages (R / Python / etc.)
    1. NINA reports
        1. ~~PDF~~
        2.  Html (started)
    2. NINA data reports
    3. NINA presentation
        1. RevealJS (presentations)
2. R graphics
    1. ggplot2-theme
    2. ~~ggplot2 color scale functions~~
        1. Improvements
    3. ~~Add logo to figures~~
3.  Shiny/Quarto templates
    1. SCSS-file for Bootstrap
    2. Example templates
        1. Dashboards
        2. Storyboards
        3. Modularised tabbed shiny app
