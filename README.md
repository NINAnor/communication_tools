# Science communication tools for NINA

This is a place where we can collect code and ideas for communication tools within NINA. It probably makes sense to split up most software we develop, e.g. in separate repositories, but this could function as a central hub.


To start, here is a list of things we like to se made:

1. Document templates for scripting languages (R / Python / etc.)
    1. NINA reports
        - ~~PDF~~
        - Html (started)
    2. NINA data reports
    3. RevealJS (presentations)
2. R graphics templates
    1. ggplot2-theme
    2. ~~ggplot2 color scale functions~~
        - Could be improved
3.  Shiny templates
    1. SCSS-file for Bootstrap
